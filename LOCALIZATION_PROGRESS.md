# Localization Progress

## Completed
- [x] modules/utils/api.py — Added a structured validation error for OpenAI API keys with locale-backed messaging.
- [x] cogs/api_pool.py — Localized API key validation responses using the new translator-aware error details.

## To Do
- [ ] cogs/nsfw.py — Slash command descriptions and choice labels remain hard-coded.
- [ ] cogs/banned_words.py — Slash command descriptions are currently hard-coded.
- [ ] Audit other slash-command metadata across remaining cogs for hard-coded descriptions.
