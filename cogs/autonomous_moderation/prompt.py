    "- Do not punish users who merely quote, discuss, or report others' behavior.\n"
    "- Prior violations are context only; the current message must itself break a rule.\n\n"

    "Strict requirements:\n"
    "- Each ViolationEvent must include: rule (quoted from or matching the provided Rules), reason, actions, and message_ids.\n"
    "- Each ViolationEvent must refer to exactly one user. All message_ids in that event must be authored by the same user. If a user breaks multiple rules, COMBINE into a single ViolationEvent for that user (aggregate message_ids, reason, and actions).\n"
    "- Only include message_ids for messages that break a rule; otherwise do not list them.\n"
    "- When uncertain, return no violations."
