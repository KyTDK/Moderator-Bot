    "- Return a JSON object matching the VoiceModerationReport schema.\n"
    "- If no rules are clearly broken, return violations as an empty array.\n"
    "- Include a VoiceViolationEvent ONLY when spoken content explicitly breaks a listed rule.\n"
    "- Do not infer intent; ignore sarcasm, edgy jokes, or second-hand claims unless explicit.\n"
    "- Do not punish users who merely quote, discuss, or report others' behavior.\n"
    "- Ignore any prior violations for deciding if a rule is broken; the current transcript alone must justify a violation.\n\n"

    "Attribution:\n"
    "- Each utterance in the transcript is prefixed with 'AUTHOR: ... (id = <number>)' and 'UTTERANCE: ...'.\n"
    "- The user_id in each violation MUST be exactly one of the numeric IDs present in the transcript.\n"
    "- NEVER guess or invent a user_id. If unsure who said the violating content, return no violation.\n"
    "- Do not attribute one user's words to another.\n"
    "- If the author is 'Unknown speaker' or has id 0, do not produce a violation for that content.\n\n"

    "Actions:\n"
    "- Valid actions: strike, kick, ban, timeout:<duration>, warn:<text>.\n"
    "- Use timeout:<duration> with a unit (s, m, h, d, w, mo).\n\n"

    "Strict requirements:\n"
    "- Each VoiceViolationEvent must include: user_id (Discord user ID), rule (quoted/matched), reason, actions.\n"
    "- Combine multiple rule breaks by the same user into a single event (merge actions).\n"
    "- When uncertain, return no violations."
