# Internationalisation (i18n) Guide

Moderator Bot ships with a file-based localisation system powered by JSON
resources stored in the `locales/` directory. Each locale has its own folder
(e.g. `locales/en/`) that mirrors the internal structure of the bot's modules.

## Locale files

Locale files are nested JSON objects. Keys are separated by dots (`.`) when they
are accessed in code. For example, given the following excerpt from
`locales/uk-UA/modules.moderation.json`:

```json
{
  "modules": {
    "moderation": {
      "strike": {
        "disciplinary": {
          "no_action": "Ніяких дій не було вжито.",
          "bulk_delete": "{deleted}/{total} повідомлень видалено одним пакетом."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can retrieve the `bulk_delete` message via the key
`modules.moderation.strike.disciplinary.bulk_delete`.

## Adding new strings

1. Identify the locale you want to update (e.g. `en` for English).
2. Create or edit the JSON file corresponding to the relevant feature.
3. Follow the existing nesting convention so the dotted key path matches the
   JSON hierarchy.

Strings can include placeholder values using Python's `str.format` syntax. For
instance, the `{deleted}` and `{total}` placeholders in the example above are
replaced at runtime.

## Fallback behaviour

If a string is missing from a requested locale, Moderator Bot automatically
falls back to the configured default and fallback locales. When this happens the
bot now logs a warning indicating which locale was missing and which fallback
was used. The log also includes a "Did you mean …?" suggestion when another
locale closely matches the requested code.
