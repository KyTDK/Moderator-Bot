It enables Moderator Bot to continue operating effectively, even when individual users face rate limits.\n\n**How does it work?**\n- When you add your OpenAI API key to the pool, it's encrypted and stored securely.\n- The bot uses these keys exclusively for accessing OpenAI models to perform moderation tasks.\n- Your API key remains confidential; no one, including the bot developers, can view it.\n- You have full control and can remove your API key from the pool at any time.\n\n**Important:** To contribute your API key, your OpenAI account must have at least $5 in prepaid credits. Even though the moderation endpoint is free to use, OpenAI requires accounts to have active billing details and quota. You can add credit to your account here: <https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview>\n\nBy contributing your API key, you help ensure that Moderator Bot remains responsive and effective for all users."
