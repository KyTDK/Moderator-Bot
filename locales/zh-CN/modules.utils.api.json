Even though the moderation model is free, OpenAI requires accounts to have valid payment details on file. To add credit, visit the [OpenAI Billing Overview](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview) page and purchase at least $5 in credits. Once you've added a payment method and credits, your API key should function correctly."
